Hi 

simple python3 script for transfer files from USB or directory to directory.

1-run conf.py for configure src and dst 

2-run python-usb.py for copying the file :) 

note *
  src is the source address
  dst is the destination address
  In Windows,type address with two(\\) like --> c:\\Users\\User\\Downloads 
  you can change the fileformats by editing  line 16 in python-usb.py ,by default is pdf and docx
